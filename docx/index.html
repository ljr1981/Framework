We already have EV_VERT/HORZ boxes, but perhaps they need something a little higher: specialized containers? Use-case?<br />2. The search component can be used anywhere, not just here. The GO! button needs a "Searcher" or "Finder" object that is linked by an agent in an actions queue.<br />3. The feature is hardly anything special. It is just a container for some form of VIEW. What this brings up is the generic notion of a "VIEW" -- what is it and do all of these things have VIEW somewhere in the lineage? Is the EV_VERT/HORZ bit above just this in practice: a VIEW?<br />4. The "Browser" bits are the most interesting. Is there a notion of a browser? Define browser?<br /><br />Browser: A VIEW that allows a user to access a filtered list of things (either text, graphics, or both).<br /><br />The browser receives a list of things from some client.<br /></div></p><map name="map_feature_search_and_browse_pg_31"></map></div><div class="Page" id="news_stream_pg_34_page"><h2>News Stream - Pg 34</h2><div class="ImageContainer"><img width="960" height="600" src="pages%5Cnews_stream_pg_34.png" usemap="#map_news_stream_pg_34" /></div><p class="Notes"><div>Show time-sensitive items in a reverse chron list, with the latest items at the top.

A typical use-case involves creating new objects and arranging them on some virtual space.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why<br /></span>This pair of panels -- a palette with which to create things, and a canvas on which to put them -- is so common that almost every user of desktop software has seen it. It's a natural mapping from familiar physical objects to the virutal on-screen world. And the palette takes advantage of visual recognition: the most common icons (paintbrush, hand, magnifying class, etc.) are reused over and over again in different applications, with the same meaning each time.<br /><br /></div></p><map name="map_canvas_plus_palette_pg_50"></map></div></body></html>
